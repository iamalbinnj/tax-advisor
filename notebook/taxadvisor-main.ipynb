In India, the TDS rate for crypto is set at 1%. Starting from July 01, 2022, the buyer will be responsible for deducting TDS at the 1% rate while making payment to the seller for the transfer of Crypto/NFT. If the transaction takes place on an exchange, then the exchange may deduct the TDS and pay the balance to the seller. Indian exchanges automatically deduct TDS, while individuals trading on foreign exchanges must manually deduct TDS and file their TDS returns.\n",

            "Query: I am a 55-year-old individual covered by my employer’s group health insurance policy, which also extends to my senior citizen parents. Last year, I experienced a significant muscle pull in my leg while participating in sports, leading to the necessity of ongoing physiotherapy. I am curious about the eligibility for tax benefits on the medical expenses related to this situation in the current financial year. Furthermore, my octogenarian father has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. In October 2023, he suffered a fall in the bathroom, resulting in a broken hip that required hip replacement surgery. Even a month after the surgery, his wound necessitated regular dressing. He is currently undergoing consistent physiotherapy, and I have employed an attendant to provide nursing care at home. Given that my father is financially dependent on me, I am interested in knowing if I can claim tax benefits on the medical expenses, including physiotherapy costs and the fees paid to the attendant, associated with my father’s health issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "Solution: As outlined in Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a deduction is allowed for the total medical expenses incurred concerning the taxpayer or their family members, capped at a maximum aggregate of ₹50,000. However, this deduction is restricted to senior citizens who have not contributed to health insurance premiums. Since you do not qualify as a senior citizen, this deduction is not applicable in your situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, a deduction is applicable for the entire sum spent on medical expenses related to the health of the taxpayer’s parent, not exceeding ₹50,000. This deduction is specifically designed for senior citizens who have not made any payments toward health insurance coverage.\n",
            "\n",
            "In line with the provisions of Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, expenses associated with hip replacement may be eligible for a deduction as medical expenses, provided they are not covered by the group insurance offered by your employer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, costs associated with physiotherapy and attendant care can also be asserted as medical expenses. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to recognize that the definition of medical expenses is open to interpretation by the tax officer, as the law does not explicitly delineate these expenses, potentially leading to legal disputes.\n",

The questioner has availed a housing loan of ₹5 lakh from their Employee’s Co-operative Credit Society. Additionally, they have obtained another home loan of ₹15 lakh from a bank for the same property. The query raised pertains to whether they can avail of tax benefits on both of these home loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "Solution: The ability to claim credit under Section 80C for the principal repayment of a home loan is subject to certain conditions. The benefits of income tax credit on home loans can be availed if the home loan is obtained from specific entities such as the government (Central or state), banks (including cooperative banks), LIC, National Housing Bank, housing finance companies, cooperative societies providing construction financing for house, public companies, public sector companies, universities, and others.\n",

            "Regarding the payment of interest, there are no restrictions on the source of borrowed funds. The individual can even demand a deduction for interest paid to friends and relatives if the borrowed money was used for the stated purpose. Therefore, they can claim a deduction for interest paid under Section 24(b) for both loans, up to a limit of ₹2 lakh, in the case of a self-occupied property. If the property is rented out, the individual can claim the full interest amount against rental income. However, any loss incurred under the head of house property can only be offset against other income up to ₹2 lakh in the same year. Any remaining unabsorbed loss can be carried forward for a maximum of eight years to offset against future house property income.\n",

            "Solution: Response from Dr. Suresh Surana, Founder of RSM India, Addressing the Question:\n",
            "\n",
            "Section 276CC of the IT Act provides for imprisonment if an individual fails to file their income tax returns. Prosecution under this section can occur if someone doesn’t submit their return of income under Section 139(1) or fails to respond to a notice issued under Section 142(1)(i) (for Enquiry before assessment), Section 148 (for Income escaping assessment), or Section 153A (for Search or Requisition) of the Income Tax Act.\n",
            "\n",
            "The proviso to Section 276CC allows some relief to honest taxpayers. Specifically, clause (ii)(b) of Section 276CC states that if the tax to be paid, as decided based on regular assessment and reduced by advance tax payments and tax deducted at source, is less than Rs. 10,000, the taxpayer will not be prosecuted for failing to file the return under Section 139(1) of the IT Act.\n",

            "In the case of Manav Menon vs Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax Crl. O.P. No. 26013 of 2021, the Madras High Court gave a decision on this matter. The taxpayer in this case failed to file their income tax return for the Assessment Year 2013-2014.\n",
            "\n",
            "Subsequently, the revenue department issued a show cause notice under Section 276CC of the IT Act, asking why proceedings under Section 276CC should not be initiated against the taxpayer for their deliberate failure to submit the return of income within the stipulated time in Section 139(1) of the IT Act. The taxpayer filed their income tax return on 14.01.2019 after receiving the notice.\n",
            "\n",
            "In light of these facts, the High Court stated that the aforementioned proviso protects genuine taxpayers who either file their returns late but before the end of the assessment year or have paid significant amounts of their unpaid/remaining tax through advance taxes. Consequently, such taxpayers are exempt from the diligence of the prosecution under Section 276CC of the IT Act.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the High Court observed that since the taxpayer had paid taxes amounting to Rs. 23,75,066/- under the categories of Advance Tax, TDS, TCS, and Self Assessment Tax, while the total tax and interest payable by them was Rs. 23,74,610/-, the proviso (ii)(b) of Section 276CC shields the taxpayer from prosecution under Section 276CC of the IT Act.\n",

            "Solution: I recommend you implement the sale deed on the actual transaction value and offer to file the differential stamp duty amount to the buyer. Your mother shall required to explain the cash source if you accept the difference in cash and want to utilize the same for the official purpose. Even online accepting of money makes you explain the nature of transactions with regard to online money that your mother obtained.

            "If the total income of a person before any deduction and exemption under section 54F surpasses the basic amount of exemption then as per the income tax laws an individual is mandated to file his ITR, even if your mother does not secure any tax liability because of the available exemption under 54F then also she is required to file the ITR.\n",

            "Solution: An individual is seeking ways to save on capital gains tax when selling properties. Let us see what experts suggest in this regard. The answer to this question offers valuable insights and strategies to minimize tax liabilities in such transactions.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to experts, the duration of property ownership plays a crucial role in determining the tax treatment of capital gains. If you have held the property for 24 months or more, any gains from its sale will be classified as long-term capital gains. However, if the property was owned for less than 24 months, the profits will be considered short-term capital gains and taxed at a slab rate accordingly.\n",
            "\n",
            "For those selling properties held for over 24 months, two options are available to save on long-term capital gains tax. The first option, outlined in Section 54F of the Income Tax Act, allows for an exemption if the proceeds from the sale are used for buying or building a residential house. The individual must invest within two years after or one year before the plot’s sale date. Alternatively, in case you build a house within three years and invest the aggregate consideration, you are liable to claim the exemption.\n",
            "\n",
            "Individuals who are unable to invest the entire amount for the above-mentioned purpose before the filing due date to deposit the unutilized money in a capital gains deposit account with a scheduled bank. You have the option to utilize the funds that have been deposited for either buying or building the house. This account can be accessed later for buying or constructing the house. To qualify for a full exemption, the entire sale consideration must be invested in the purchase of residential property. Otherwise, the exemption will be proportionate to the total consideration invested.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another option available under Section 54EC is to invest in capital gains bonds issued by some particular financial institutions such as REC (Rural Electrification Corporation), NHAI (National Highway Authority of India), PFC (Power Finance Corporation), and RFC (Railway Finance Corporation). However, only the indexed long-term capital gains, need to be invested in these bonds not the whole of the sale consideration in the bonds in order to qualify for the exemption under Section 54EC.\n",
            "\n",
            "The entire sale consideration is not included in this. There is a threshold of up to Rs. 50 lakh on claiming exemption under Section 54EC for a single financial year. The investment must be made within six months from the date of the property sale, even if it extends beyond the income tax return filing deadline. Notably, there is no requirement to deposit unutilized funds in a capital gains deposit account. These bonds currently offer an annual coupon rate of 5.25%, which is taxable.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these expert recommendations, property sellers can effectively manage their capital gains tax obligations while maximizing their returns from property transactions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Query: In a bid to secure joint ownership of a flat in the National Capital Region (NCR), a taxpayer is looking for ways to effectively manage the associated tax burdens. The individual (the husband) plans to contribute 70% of the property’s cost, while the spouse will contribute the remaining 30%. To finance their purchase, they have taken separate home loans. The couple intends to rent out the newly acquired flat, which is subject to taxes on the rental income. It is worth noting that the wife falls within the 10% tax bracket, while he falls under the higher 30% tax slab. Consequently, they are planning to minimize their overall tax burden. As part of their tax planning, he is asking whether his wife can increase her share in the property by paying him for that share. However, they are uncertain whether it is necessary to explicitly mention the percentage of their respective ownership shares in the sale deed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Solution: According to the Income Tax Act of 1961, the person who pays for an asset is responsible for the taxable income generated from it. In this case, since the taxpayer is contributing 70% of the funds and his wife is contributing 30%, he can declare the rental income in both their names based on their respective shares in the property.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is important to keep in mind that if the rental income is disproportionate, it may have negative consequences under Section 60. This section states that the income will be combined with the asset owner’s income if the income is transferred without transferring the asset.\n",

            "Any income earned from renting out the mentioned property will be subject to taxation under the category of “Income from House Property.” A deduction of 30% of the rent received is allowed. The full interest on loans taken for such properties can be exempted from taxes under Section 24. Principal repayments on loans taken to purchase residential houses are eligible for tax deductions within the overall limit of ₹1.5 lakh under Section 80C.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is possible for the wife to buy shares in the property, with the minimum property valuation determined by prevailing stamp duty rates under Section 50C of the Income Tax Act.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the plot qualifies as a long-term capital asset at the time of sale (held for more than 24 months), the taxpayer may consider reinvesting the capital gains in purchasing or constructing another residential house to reduce the impact of capital gains tax. This option is subject to the conditions under Section 54F. Alternatively, given that the taxpayer and his wife are considered “relatives” under the Income Tax Act, gifting can also be another alternative.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, please note that both options will require additional registration and payment of stamp duty fees to establish the revised ownership structure in official documents. Finally, to ensure clear succession planning and avoid any future ambiguity, it is highly recommended to define each individual’s share in the sale deed.\n",

            "\n",
            "Solution: Mrinal Mitra, an NRI who is currently a Canadian resident, seeks clarification saying that his ancestral home in Kolkata is being sold, from which he anticipates receiving approximately Rs 15 lakh as his share. Mrinal intends to deposit this money into a joint account with his daughter at the State Bank of India in New Delhi. However, his daughter is currently a student in Canada. Mrinal sought guidance on how to manage the funds from the sale of his ancestral property to minimize potential long-term capital gains tax and find the best investment options. He is asking whether he can invest in any State Bank of India plan.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s important to clarify that the ancestral property in question is a residential house, let’s assume, is inherited by Mrinal, constituting a long-term asset due to the extended ownership history. To calculate taxable capital gains, the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“ITA”) allows for a deduction of the cost at which the previous owner acquired the property, proportionate to Mrinal’s share. Additionally, he may be eligible for indexation benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "To mitigate long-term capital gains tax, Mrinal has two options from which he can benefit and they are outlined in the Income Tax Act (ITA). He can invest the capital gains in a residential house property (“RHP”) in India within specific regulations provided by Section 54 of the ITA or he can make an investment in particular bonds in India for the long-term under Section 54EC of the ITA. He can purchase a new RHP within one year before the property’s transfer, within two years after the transfer, or construct a new RHP within three years after the transfer, as per Section 54.\n",
            "\n",
            "If Mrinal is unable to utilize the capital gains for the purchase or construction of a new asset before filing his income tax return, he can still claim the exemption by depositing the sale proceeds, on account of RHP, under the Capital Gain Account Scheme, 1988 (“Scheme”). This deposited amount is considered the cost of the new asset, making it eligible for exemption under Section 54 of the ITA. To do this, he can open a Capital Gain bank account with a bank notified by the government, generally, one of the scheduled banks like the State Bank of India.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, Section 54EC of the ITA allows him to save on tax by investing the capital gains amount in long-term bonds issued by entities like the National Highways Authority of India (“NHAI”) and RECL within six months from the property’s transfer. Regarding the joint account with his daughter, it’s important to note that since his daughter has no ownership share in the property sold, any tax implications, if applicable, would only concern Mrinal, in this case, and his daughter will not be subject to taxation as she was not the property owner.\n",

            "Query: A student seeks clarification on Form 15G and ITR filing asking the question, that he does not have any other sources of income except for interest earned from FD (bank fixed deposit). The student disclosed that the funds were provided by their father and was confused if submitting Form 15G would allow them to avoid Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) deductions. Additionally, he is not sure if filing an income tax return would still be necessary if he submits Form 15G.\n",
            "\n",
            "Solution: In the case of minors, it is mandatory to combine all passive income with the income of a parent who earns a higher income. Consequently, minors are not permitted to submit Form 15G, as the interest income they earn will be taxed in the parent’s hands. On the other hand, in the case of majors, the interest income will be subject to taxation in their own hands. However, it is important to consider any gift transactions made by their father at the time of the gift, there will be no tax implication either for the student (in this case) or for the father. If the interest income of the questioner, for the year falls below the taxable limit of 2.50 lakhs and there is no tax liability, then the individual can submit Form No. 15G to the bank. This allows the bank to pay interest without deducting tax at source.\n",
            "\n",
            "To ensure successful submission of Form No. 15G, it is crucial to provide accurate PAN (Permanent Account Number) details. Failure to furnish this information will result in the bank deducting tax at a higher rate of 20% instead of the regular TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) rate of 10%. It is important to note that submitting Form 15G does not necessitate the filing of an income tax return (ITR). The requirement to file an ITR is depended on different conditions, independent of the provisions for submitting Form No. 15G.\n",

Even after she has already submitted a 15G form to avoid tax deduction at the source, the bank has deducted tax at a 20% rate on the grounds of not having a PAN. The bank advised that she needed to file an ITR to claim the refund. How can we proceed to seek a refund? Can she file her ITR if she does not have a PAN card?\n",

            "Solution: Here is the suitable response for such a situation as per the regulations:\n",

            "Under Section 206AA, the bank can deduct tax at a rate of 20% on the interest, if your mother doesn’t have a permanent account number (PAN), even if she submitted a 15G form. In this case, as you have said that your mother is a senior citizen then she should have submitted a 15H form, not form 15G. If the aggregate tax on the income of a senior citizen who is a resident is nil, then only the form No. 15 is required to be submitted.\n",
            "\n",
            "To claim a refund for the tax already deducted by the bank, it’s essential to file her income tax return (ITR). However, she cannot file her ITR if she does not have a PAN. Therefore, on her behalf, you need to apply for a PAN card first.\n",

            "If she has an Aadhaar Number, it can be used in place of a PAN. Provide her Aadhaar number to the bank and request them to update their TDS return submitted by them to update her name with her PAN/Aadhaar information. Without making this correction, the bank will not provide your mother credit for the deducted tax.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, even if she submits a 15H form, she still needs to furnish her PAN/Aadhaar, or else the bank will deduct tax at a 20% rate again on the entire interest. It’s important to keep in mind that filing an income tax return is not mandatory merely because you have a PAN, it depends if you meet the conditions that require you to file an ITR.\n",

            "Income generated from renting out a residential property is subject to taxation under the heading ‘income from house property.’ Provided deductions include municipal taxes, a standard deduction of 30%, and interest on borrowed funds.

If equity shares or equity-oriented mutual funds are sold within one year, taxpayers have to pay short-term capital (STCG) on the profits. The STCG tax rate depends on whether the securities transaction tax (STT) is applicable or not. If STT is applicable, the STCG tax rate is 15%.

In that case, section 194J will be applicable, and TDS will be deducted at a flat rate of 10%. This is usually the case for non-executive directors or independent directors who do not have an employer-employee relationship with the company.

It has stated that TCS is to be collected on the sales consideration that includes GST as well. This is because TCS is not a tax on income but an interim levy on the possible income earned from the sale of goods. Therefore, it does not affect the valuation of goods or services under GST.

You can verify the amount of tax deducted at source from your income by checking your Form 26AS, which is a consolidated statement of all TDS transactions. You should claim the TDS credit in your income tax return based on the amount reflected in Form 26AS and not on any other document or source. You should claim TDS with your income tax return file, as the TDS credit is being reflected in Form 26AS. If there is a mismatch between the TDS credit in Form 26AS and the TDS claim in your return of income, the tax authorities may reject your claim.\n",

If the seller is a non-resident, then the tax will be deducted under section 195 of the Income Tax Act and not under section 194-IA.
