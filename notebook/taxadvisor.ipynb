This means that you need to provide your Aadhaar number while filling out your ITR form. However, if you have not yet linked your PAN and Aadhaar, you can still file your return, but you will have limited access on the portal. It is advisable to link your PAN with Aadhaar as soon as possible to avoid any inconvenience during the ITR filing process. So, in short, Aadhaar is necessary for filing ITR, as it serves as an important identification document required by the tax authorities."
